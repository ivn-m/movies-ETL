# movies-ETL

The purpose of this repository is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We took three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data; and performed the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
